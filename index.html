            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Module 1: Gearing Up for Success: Your First Clubs & Equipment</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-6 italic">Welcome to the foundational course designed to transform a complete novice into a confident golfer, equipped with both the essential skills and the nuanced understanding of the game. This comprehensive guide is structured as a step-by-step curriculum, meticulously detailing every aspect of golf, from selecting the right equipment to mastering fundamental techniques, navigating the course with strategic acumen, and cultivating the mental fortitude required for sustained improvement. The principles and techniques discussed herein are drawn from the collective wisdom of seasoned golf professionals, tailored to provide a clear, relatable, and actionable path for every aspiring golfer.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Golden Rule for Beginners: Start with a Half-Set</h3>
            <p>For those new to golf, the immediate temptation might be to acquire a full set of fourteen clubs, as permitted by the rules of golf. However, experienced instructors almost universally advise against this initial investment. A more pragmatic and effective approach involves starting with a carefully curated "half-set" of approximately eight to ten clubs. This limited selection is not a compromise; it is a deliberate strategy designed to simplify the learning process, reduce upfront costs, and, most importantly, allow the beginner to focus on mastering core techniques without being overwhelmed by too many options. Learning a few clubs well is infinitely better than learning many clubs poorly.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Essential Beginner Clubs: Building Your Foundation</h3>
            <p>Your starter bag should be a collection of the most versatile and forgiving clubs available. These are the "must-haves" that will allow you to play a full round of golf while focusing on skill development. Here's a breakdown of what to include and why:</p>
            
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-4">
                <li><strong>Driver:</strong> This club is primarily used for tee shots on long holes, designed to achieve maximum distance. For beginners, the goal is not to hit it 300 yards, but to get the ball in the air and in play. Look for a driver with a larger head (460cc is the standard maximum size), a higher loft (10.5 degrees or more), and a flexible shaft (a 'Regular' or 'Senior' flex is often best for slower swing speeds). The higher loft is a game-changer for new players as it helps get the ball airborne more easily, while the larger clubhead offers a bigger "sweet spot" for greater forgiveness on mishits.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Fairway Wood (5-wood or 7-wood) or Hybrid (6-hybrid):</strong> These clubs are incredibly versatile and a beginner's best friend. They can be used from the tee on shorter holes or from the fairway for long-distance shots. A 5-wood or 7-wood is often preferred over a 3-wood because their higher loft makes them easier to launch the ball into the air, which is crucial for new players. Similarly, a 6-hybrid is a highly recommended and forgiving alternative to challenging long irons (3, 4, 5-irons). Hybrids combine the distance of a wood with the accuracy of an iron, making them far easier to hit than traditional long irons.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Mid-Irons (6, 7, 8-iron):</strong> These irons are the workhorses of your bag. They are excellent for practicing the full swing and are essential for approach shots to the green. The **7-iron**, in particular, is often considered the most important iron for a beginner to master. Its manageable length and loft make it the ideal club for learning proper swing mechanics. Cavity-back irons are a non-negotiable for beginners. This design redistributes weight to the perimeter of the clubhead, creating a larger sweet spot and significantly more forgiveness on off-center hits.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Wedges (Pitching Wedge and Sand Wedge):</strong> The pitching wedge (PW) is commonly included in iron sets and is used for shorter approach shots and chip shots from just off the green. A sand wedge (SW) is essential for escaping bunkers and is also versatile for pitching and chipping. For a beginner, mastering these two wedges is more than enough to handle most short game situations. The lob wedge (LW) can be added later as you develop a more nuanced short game.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Putter:</strong> Arguably the most-used club in the bag, the putter is indispensable for getting the ball into the hole on the green. Choosing a putter is largely a matter of personal preference. There are two main types: a **blade** putter (a classic, simple design) and a **mallet** putter (a larger head with more weight distributed for stability). A mallet putter is often recommended for beginners due to its greater forgiveness and alignment aids. The key is to find one that feels comfortable and helps you aim confidently.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Understanding "Forgiveness" in Clubs: Your Best Friend as a Beginner</h3>
            <p>The term "forgiveness" in golf clubs refers to their inherent ability to minimize the negative effects of imperfect swings or off-center hits. For beginners, this characteristic is invaluable, as it allows the ball to travel straighter and farther than it would with a less forgiving club, even when contact is not perfectly struck. Forgiveness is not a crutch; it's a tool that helps you stay in the game and build confidence while you develop a repeatable swing.</p>
            
            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">The Anatomy of a Forgiving Club: What to Look For</h4>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Oversized Heads and Large "Sweet Spots":</strong> Clubs designed for forgiveness often have larger clubheads, providing a bigger hitting area. This increases the likelihood of making solid contact and reduces the impact of mishits. The "sweet spot" is the point on the clubface that transfers the most energy to the ball. A forgiving club has a larger, more consistent sweet spot.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Cavity Back Design and Perimeter Weighting:</strong> Many beginner-friendly irons feature a cavity in the back of the clubhead. This design redistributes mass from the center of the club to its perimeter (the "perimeter weighting"), which makes the clubhead more stable on off-center strikes. This stability prevents the clubface from twisting, leading to straighter shots.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Wider Soles and Thicker Top Edges:</strong> These design elements further contribute to stability and help the club glide through the turf more effectively. A wider sole reduces the chance of "fat" shots (where the club digs into the ground before hitting the ball), while a thicker top edge instills confidence at address.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Graphite Shafts:</strong> For new golfers, graphite shafts are generally recommended over steel. They are significantly lighter, which allows for easier swinging and greater clubhead speed, helping to launch the ball higher with less effort. While steel shafts are more durable and provide more feedback, the initial focus for beginners should be on ease of use and launch.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Higher Loft:</strong> Forgiving irons and woods typically have higher lofts. Loft is the angle of the clubface relative to the ground. A higher loft is designed to help players with slower swing speeds get the ball easily into the air, which is a common challenge for beginners.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Beyond Clubs: Other Essential Equipment</h3>
            <p>In addition to your clubs, there are a few other pieces of equipment you'll need to start playing.</p>
            
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Golf Bag:</strong> You'll need a bag to carry your clubs. A **stand bag** is the most common and versatile choice for beginners as it is lightweight and has built-in legs, making it easy to carry or use on a golf cart.</li>
                <li><strong>Golf Glove:</strong> A glove, worn on the non-dominant hand (the left hand for a right-handed golfer), improves your grip on the club, reduces tension, and prevents blisters.</li>
                <li><strong>Golf Tees:</strong> Tees are used on the tee box to elevate the ball. You will need a variety of sizes for different clubs, especially longer tees for your driver.</li>
                <li><strong>Golf Shoes:</strong> While not strictly necessary for your first few outings, proper golf shoes with spikes (either metal or plastic) provide the traction and stability needed to maintain balance throughout your swing.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Basic Equipment Rules: Playing by the Book</h3>
            <p>Understanding the fundamental rules governing equipment is essential for playing golf fairly and respectfully. The main rule to remember as a beginner is the **14-club limit**. It's a key rule, but not one you'll have to worry about at first with a starter set. You are also not allowed to share clubs with your playing partners during a round. These rules are designed to ensure that success in golf depends on a player's judgment, skills, and abilities, rather than artificial advantages.</p>

        <!-- Module 2: The Essential Basics: Understanding the Golf Course & Scoring -->
        <div id="module2" class="module-content hidden">
            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Module 2: The Essential Basics: Understanding the Golf Course & Scoring</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-6 italic">Before you swing a club, you need to understand the field of play. This module introduces you to the basic layout of a golf course, the terminology used, and the fundamental concept of scoring. Knowing these basics will help you navigate the course confidently and track your progress accurately.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Anatomy of a Golf Hole</h3>
            <p>A standard golf course consists of 18 holes, each with a specific design and set of components. Understanding these parts is key to playing the game.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Tee Box:</strong> The starting point for each hole. This is where you place your ball on a tee for the first shot.</li>
                <li><strong>Fairway:</strong> The well-maintained, short grass area that runs from the tee box to the green. This is the ideal place to hit your second shot.</li>
                <li><strong>Rough:</strong> The longer, thicker grass that borders the fairway. Hitting your ball here makes the next shot more difficult.</li>
                <li><strong>Bunker (Sand Trap):</strong> A sand-filled depression on the course. Getting your ball in a bunker requires a specific type of shot to get out.</li>
                <li><strong>Green:</strong> The area of extremely short, finely manicured grass where the hole (or "cup") is located. This is where you use your putter.</li>
                <li><strong>The Hole (or Cup):</strong> The 4.25-inch diameter hole into which you are trying to get the ball.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Basics of Scoring: Par and Strokes</h3>
            <p>Golf is a simple game of counting strokes. The goal is to complete each hole in the fewest strokes possible. A "stroke" is any forward motion of the club intended to strike the ball.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Par:</strong> The predetermined number of strokes a skilled golfer should take to complete a hole. This is the benchmark for scoring. Holes are designated as a Par 3, Par 4, or Par 5, indicating their length and difficulty.</li>
                <li><strong>Scoring Terms:</strong>
                    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Birdie:</strong> One stroke under par (e.g., 2 shots on a Par 3).</li>
                        <li><strong>Par:</strong> A score of zero relative to par (e.g., 4 shots on a Par 4).</li>
                        <li><strong>Bogey:</strong> One stroke over par (e.g., 5 shots on a Par 4).</li>
                        <li><strong>Double Bogey:</strong> Two strokes over par.</li>
                        <li><strong>Triple Bogey:</strong> Three strokes over par.</li>
                        <li><strong>Eagle:</strong> Two strokes under par.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4">Your final score is the total number of strokes for all 18 holes. You'll hear golfers refer to their score "relative to par" (e.g., "I shot a +10 today").</p>

        <!-- Module 3: Grip, Posture, and Stance: The Blueprint for a Consistent Swing -->
        <div id="module3" class="module-content hidden">
            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Module 3: Grip, Posture, and Stance: The Blueprint for a Consistent Swing</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-6 italic">Before you can master the dynamic, fluid motion of a golf swing, you must first master the static fundamentals. Your grip, posture, and stance are the "blueprint" for every shot you take. They dictate your balance, control, and ability to generate power. Errors in these foundational elements cannot be corrected later in the swing; they simply lead to a lifetime of frustrating compensations. This module provides a detailed, step-by-step guide to building a solid setup that will serve as the launchpad for a powerful and repeatable swing.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Your Grip: The Single Most Important Connection to the Club</h3>
            <p>The grip is your only physical connection to the club, and how you hold it has a direct and immediate impact on the clubface's orientation at impact, which in turn determines the direction and spin of the ball. A good grip is a light grip, a consistent grip, and one that unifies the hands so they work together as a single unit.</p>
            
            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">Three Primary Grip Types for a Solid Foundation</h4>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-4">
                <li>
                    <strong>Ten-Finger (Baseball) Grip:</strong> This is the simplest and most natural grip for a beginner. It involves all ten fingers on the club, with the hands placed close together but not linked. The index finger of the top hand should touch the pinky finger of the bottom hand.
                    <p class="mt-2"><strong>Pros:</strong> Easiest to learn, great for building hand-eye coordination, and can help generate maximum clubhead speed due to its free-flowing nature. Many power hitters, including professionals, use a variation of this grip.
                    <br><strong>Cons:</strong> Can lead to a lack of hand unity, where the hands work independently rather than as a single unit, which can make it harder to control the clubface.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Overlapping (Vardon) Grip:</strong> The most common grip among professional golfers. To form it, the pinky finger of your trailing hand (right hand for a right-handed golfer) rests in the groove between the index and middle finger of your lead hand.
                    <p class="mt-2"><strong>Pros:</strong> Promotes a more unified hand action, which leads to better clubface control and consistency. It's excellent for reducing hand and wrist tension during the swing.
                    <br><strong>Cons:</strong> Can feel unnatural at first and may require time to get used to. Players with smaller hands might find this grip challenging to execute properly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Interlocking Grip:</strong> Made famous by legends like Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. This grip involves interlocking the pinky of the trailing hand with the index finger of the lead hand.
                    <p class="mt-2"><strong>Pros:</strong> Provides the tightest connection between the hands, ensuring they move as a single unit. It's often recommended for players with smaller hands or for those who struggle with hand unity.
                    <br><strong>Cons:</strong> Can lead to excessive tension in the hands and forearms, which can inhibit a free-flowing swing. It may not be suitable for everyone and can be uncomfortable for some players.</p>

            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">The Art of Grip Pressure: "Holding a Tube of Toothpaste"</h4>
            <p>Once you've chosen a grip type, the amount of pressure you apply is the next critical factor. The old adage is to hold the club as if you are "holding a tube of toothpaste and you don't want to squeeze any out." This light, yet firm, grip pressure allows the hands and wrists to remain flexible, which is essential for a fluid swing. Too much tension will stiffen your arms and shoulders, killing clubhead speed and preventing the natural wrist hinge needed for a powerful strike.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Your Posture: The Athletic Foundation of a Golf Swing</h3>
            <p>Your posture at address is the athletic position that allows your body to rotate freely and powerfully. A common mistake for beginners is to stand too tall or too hunched over. The goal is to achieve an athletic, balanced position where you can easily turn your torso without losing your balance.</p>
            
            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">A Step-by-Step Guide to Perfect Posture</h4>
            <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Stand Tall and Relax:</strong> Begin by standing straight with your feet roughly shoulder-width apart, holding the club in front of you.</li>
                <li><strong>Bend from the Hips:</strong> From a standing position, simply push your hips back and bend forward from your hips (not your waist). This is the most crucial step. Your back should feel straight, not rounded.</li>
                <li><strong>Add a Slight Knee Flex:</strong> Once you have bent from the hips, introduce a slight flex to your knees. Your knees should be positioned directly over your ankles, not past your toes. This adds stability and athletic readiness.</li>
                <li><strong>Let Your Arms Hang:</strong> With your posture set, let your arms hang naturally down from your shoulders. Your hands and arms should form a loose triangle with your chest. This position ensures your arms are in the correct place to swing the club around your body, not just up and down.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Stance & Ball Position: Setting Up for Every Shot</h3>
            <p>The width of your stance and the position of the ball relative to your feet are crucial for optimizing each club's performance. The goal is to create the ideal conditions for the club to strike the ball with the proper trajectory and power.</p>
            
            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">Stance Width: Stability vs. Mobility</h4>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Driver:</strong> A wider stance, typically a little more than shoulder-width, provides the stability needed to make a full, powerful turn and transfer weight effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Irons & Wedges:</strong> A narrower stance, about shoulder-width, allows for more dynamic hip and torso rotation, which is vital for the downward strike required to hit irons crisply.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4 class="text-xl font-bold">Ball Position: The Key to Consistent Contact</h4>
            <p>The ball position is a key variable you must change for each club. The goal is to set the ball in a position that allows the club to strike it at the ideal point in the swing arc. Here's a quick guide (for a right-handed golfer):</p>

        <div id="module4" class="module-content hidden">
            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Module 4: The Perfect Takeaway: Initiating the Swing</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-6 italic">The takeaway is the first movement of your golf swing, and it sets the stage for everything that follows. A smooth and controlled takeaway is critical for getting the club on the right path. This module will show you how to start your swing correctly, ensuring a solid foundation for the rest of your motion.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The "One-Piece" Takeaway</h3>
            <p>The goal of the takeaway is for your shoulders, arms, and club to move away from the ball in a synchronized unit, often referred to as a "one-piece" takeaway. This prevents an early break of the wrists, which can throw the club off-plane and make the rest of the swing a struggle.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>The Triangle:</strong> Imagine your arms and shoulders form a triangle. This triangle should stay intact as you begin to move the club away from the ball.</li>
                <li><strong>Shoulder-Led Motion:</strong> Initiate the takeaway with a turn of your shoulders, not with your hands and arms. Your hands should simply be along for the ride.</li>
                <li><strong>Path:</strong> The clubhead should move slightly inside the target line as it goes back, with the clubface remaining square to your swing path. A good check is to see if the clubhead is still in front of your hands when it reaches hip height.</li>
            </ul>

        <div id="module5" class="module-content hidden">
            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Module 5: The Backswing: Coiling for Power</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-6 italic">The backswing is the continuation of the takeaway, where you coil your body to create potential energy. This is the moment to build power and set the club in a position from which you can deliver a powerful strike. An effective backswing is all about a full body turn and proper weight transfer.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Turn: The Engine of the Swing</h3>
            <p>A full shoulder turn is the engine of your swing. Your shoulders should turn perpendicular to your spine, with your lead shoulder rotating under your chin. The hips will turn, but the majority of the turn should be in your torso.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Shoulders vs. Hips:</strong> For a powerful swing, your shoulders should turn significantly more than your hips. This "X-factor" creates a stretch that stores energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Weight Transfer:</strong> As you turn, your weight should shift smoothly to the inside of your trail foot (right foot for a right-handed golfer). This is a crucial step for storing the energy you'll unleash in the downswing.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Wrist Hinge: Creating Lag</h3>
            <p>As your hands reach the top of the backswing, your wrists will naturally hinge, or "cock." This hinge is key for creating lag, which is the angle between your lead arm and the club shaft. This angle is a major contributor to clubhead speed.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Natural Movement:</strong> The wrist hinge should feel like a natural, passive movement, not a forced one. The club's momentum should help your wrists hinge.</li>
                <li><strong>Top of the Backswing:</strong> At the top, the club should be in a solid position, your hands high, your shoulders fully coiled, and your weight centered over your trail foot.</li>
            </ul>

        <div id="module6" class="module-content hidden">
            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Module 6: The Downswing: Unleashing the Power</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-6 italic">The downswing is where all the power you've built in the backswing is unleashed. It's a chain reaction that starts from the ground up, culminating in the precise moment the clubhead meets the ball. Mastering this phase is the key to consistent, powerful ball striking.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Ground-Up Sequence</h3>
            <p>The downswing should not be a violent, arms-first lunge at the ball. Instead, it's a carefully sequenced rotation of your body, starting with the hips. This is known as the "kinetic chain."</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>The Hip Bump:</strong> The downswing is initiated by a subtle shift of your hips towards the target. This "bump" creates separation between your upper and lower body and helps drop your arms "into the slot," or on the correct path.</li>
                <li><strong>Uncoiling the Torso:</strong> As your hips rotate, your torso follows. This unwinding motion pulls the arms and club through the hitting zone. The feeling should be that the hips are leading, with the torso, arms, and club all following in a coordinated sequence.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Lag: The Secret to Clubhead Speed</h3>
            <p>Lag is the angle between your lead arm and the club shaft that is created in the backswing and maintained into the downswing. It's the "secret" to clubhead speed. As you approach impact, this angle will release, creating a powerful whip-like motion. An early release of this angle (known as "casting") is a common power killer for beginners.</p>

        <!-- Module 7: Impact: The Moment of Truth -->
        <div id="module7" class="module-content hidden">
            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Module 7: Impact: The Moment of Truth</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-6 italic">Impact is often considered the most important millisecond in golf. All the preceding movements are designed to get you to this one point with a square clubface and maximum speed. The key to a good impact is a descending blow for irons and a sweeping motion for the driver.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Iron Impact: Hitting Down</h3>
            <p>For irons, the goal is to hit the ball first and then the ground (taking a divot). This ensures solid contact and proper ball flight. A common mistake is to try and "scoop" the ball into the air, which results in a thin shot or a "fat" shot.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Contact First:</strong> Your hands should be slightly ahead of the clubhead at impact. This is a critical move to ensure you hit the ball first and get a crisp, clean strike.</li>
                <li><strong>The Divot:</strong> A shallow divot in front of the ball is the reward for a good iron shot. It proves you hit the ball first and compressed it against the turf, which creates spin and a high, penetrating ball flight.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Driver Impact: Hitting Up</h3>
            <p>The driver is the exception to the "hitting down" rule. With the driver, the goal is to hit the ball on the upswing to maximize distance. The ball is teed up high to make this possible.</p>
        </div>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Module 8: The Follow-Through: Completing the Swing and Maintaining Balance</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-6 italic">The follow-through is more than just a flourish at the end of your swing; it’s a crucial indicator of what happened during the downswing and a key element for maintaining balance. A good follow-through is a direct result of a well-executed swing and a commitment to the shot.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Follow-Through: The Grand Finish</h3>
            <p>A balanced, full follow-through is the sign of a complete and efficient swing. If you find yourself off-balance, it’s a sign that something went wrong earlier in the swing, likely in your posture or weight transfer.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Full Extension:</strong> Immediately after impact, your arms should extend out towards the target, with the club moving along the target line. This is a crucial phase for controlling the direction of the ball.</li>
                <li><strong>The Full Turn:</strong> The body continues to turn until you are facing the target. Your chest, hips, and belt buckle should all be pointing towards your target.</li>
                <li><strong>Weight on the Lead Foot:</strong> At the finish, virtually all your weight should be on your lead foot (left foot). Your trail foot (right foot) should be on its toe, with the heel pointing to the target.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Key to Balance: The Static Finish</h3>
            <p>The goal is to be able to hold your finish position for a few seconds without wobbling. This is called a "static finish." If you can hold this position, it means your swing was in balance and your weight transferred properly. This is an excellent way to self-diagnose your swing without needing a video camera.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-6 italic">The driver is the longest and most powerful club in your bag, designed specifically to launch the ball as far as possible off the tee. Hitting it well is one of the most satisfying feelings in golf, but it requires a slightly different approach than your iron swing.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Driver's Unique Setup</h3>
            <p>To hit a driver well, you need to hit the ball on the upswing. Your setup must reflect this goal.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Wider Stance:</strong> Use a stance that's slightly wider than your shoulders for a stable base to generate power.</li>
                <li><strong>Ball Position:</strong> The ball should be positioned forward in your stance, aligned with the inside of your lead heel. This encourages you to hit the ball on the upswing.</li>
                <li><strong>Spine Tilt:</strong> Tilt your spine away from the target, so your trail shoulder is lower than your lead shoulder. This also promotes an upward angle of attack.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Driver Swing</h3>
            <p>While the overall swing mechanics are similar to an iron, the driver swing is a sweeping motion, not a downward one.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Full Turn, Full Finish:</strong> Focus on a full, athletic turn in your backswing and a committed follow-through.</li>
                <li><strong>Sweep, Don't Dig:</strong> Unlike an iron shot where you hit down on the ball, with the driver you are trying to "sweep" the ball off the tee. The goal is a clean hit with a high launch angle.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-6 italic">Irons are the workhorses of your bag, used for approach shots to the green. Consistency and accuracy are far more important than raw distance with these clubs. This module will focus on the keys to hitting solid, crisp iron shots.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Iron Setup: A Compact and Balanced Base</h3>
            <p>The setup for an iron shot is more compact than a driver, promoting a downward angle of attack.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Stance:</strong> A shoulder-width stance is ideal for irons, providing stability without restricting hip rotation.</li>
                <li><strong>Ball Position:</strong> The ball should be in the center of your stance or just slightly forward of center. This allows you to hit down on the ball.</li>
                <li><strong>Weight Distribution:</strong> At address, your weight should be slightly more on your lead foot (about 55-60%). This pre-sets you for the proper descending blow.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Key to a Great Iron Shot: The Descending Blow</h3>
            <p>A good iron shot is defined by the sound and feel of the club hitting the ball first and then taking a divot. This is the "descending blow" or "hitting down on the ball."</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Impact Position:</strong> At impact, your hands should be slightly ahead of the clubhead. This is a critical move to ensure you hit the ball first and get a crisp, clean strike.</li>
                <li><strong>The Divot:</strong> A shallow divot is the reward for a good iron shot. It proves you hit the ball first and compressed it against the turf, which creates spin and a high, penetrating ball flight.</li>

            <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-6 italic">Putting is a game within a game, demanding precision, feel, and a steady hand. A well-executed putt is a combination of reading the green, controlling your speed, and a repeatable stroke. This is where you can save the most strokes on the course.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Setup: A Foundation for Consistency</h3>
            <p>A consistent putting stroke starts with a consistent setup. The goal is to create a pendulum-like motion, swinging the putter back and forth with your shoulders, not your wrists.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Posture:</strong> Bend from your hips with your eyes directly over the ball. This is crucial for seeing your line correctly.</li>
                <li><strong>Grip:</strong> A relaxed grip is key. Use a putting grip (reverse overlap is common) that allows your hands to work as a single unit.</li>
                <li><strong>Ball Position:</strong> Place the ball slightly forward of center in your stance. This encourages a slight upswing at impact for a true roll.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Reading the Green: The Art of Anticipation</h3>
            <p>Reading a green is about understanding how the slope and grain will affect the path of your putt. Always read the putt from both sides of the hole, and even from behind the ball, to get a complete picture.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>The High Side:</strong> When putting on a sloped green, always aim for the "high side," meaning the part of the hole that is uphill. The ball will naturally break and roll down the slope.</li>
                <li><strong>Feel the Green:</strong> Walk on the green and feel the slope with your feet. Your feet are a surprisingly accurate tool for sensing the undulations of the green.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Distance Control: The Key to Sinking Putts</h3>
            <p>For most golfers, distance control is more important than line. A putt that is the right distance will always be close to the hole, even if the line is off. A putt with the wrong speed, however, will be far from the hole.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>The Pendulum Stroke:</strong> Let the putter swing back and through like a pendulum, with the length of the backswing dictating the distance. A longer backswing for a longer putt, a shorter one for a shorter putt.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice Drills:</strong> Use a drill where you hit putts to a specific distance marker, not just the hole, to develop a feel for speed.</li>

            <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-6 italic">A chip shot is a short, low-flying shot that runs a good distance along the ground, used when you are close to the green and have a clean lie. The goal is to get the ball on the green and rolling like a putt as quickly as possible. This is a great way to save a stroke from just off the green.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Chipping Setup: The Mini-Swing</h3>
            <p>The chipping setup is a miniature version of your iron setup, designed for a more controlled, wrist-free motion.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Narrow Stance:</strong> Use a very narrow stance, with your feet close together. This limits your lower body movement.</li>
                <li><strong>Ball Position:</strong> The ball should be back in your stance, towards your trail foot. This encourages a descending blow and a low trajectory.</li>
                <li><strong>Weight Forward:</strong> Put about 70-80% of your weight on your lead foot. This also promotes the descending angle of attack and prevents you from lifting up on the shot.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Chipping Motion: No Wrists, Just Shoulders</h3>
            <p>The chipping motion is a simple rocking of your shoulders, like a putting stroke. The wrists should be locked and passive throughout the swing.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>The Pendulum:</strong> Think of your arms and shoulders as one unit, swinging back and through. The length of the backswing will determine the distance of the chip.</li>
                <li><strong>Firm Wrists:</strong> The most common mistake in chipping is too much wrist action. Keep your wrists firm and passive to ensure a consistent, predictable strike.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Module 13: Pitching: The High-Lofted Shot</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-6 italic">A pitch shot is a high-flying shot that lands softly and stops quickly. You use a pitch shot when you need to get the ball over an obstacle like a bunker, water, or tall grass. It is a finesse shot that requires a bit more clubhead speed and wrist hinge than a chip.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Pitching Setup: The Foundation for Flight</h3>
            <p>The pitching setup is a blend of a chipping setup and a full swing setup. It’s designed to create a high, soft-landing shot.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Slightly Wider Stance:</strong> Use a slightly wider stance than a chip, about shoulder-width, to allow for more body rotation.</li>
                <li><strong>Ball Position:</strong> The ball should be centered in your stance. This allows you to use the loft of the club to get the ball into the air.</li>
                <li><strong>Club Selection:</strong> Use a high-lofted wedge, such as a sand wedge or a lob wedge.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Pitching Motion: The "Mini" Full Swing</h3>
            <p>The pitching motion is a mini version of your full swing, using a proper wrist hinge and a full body turn to generate the necessary loft and spin.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>The Wrist Hinge:</strong> A key difference from chipping is the active wrist hinge. As you take the club back, your wrists will cock, and then uncock naturally on the downswing.</li>
                <li><strong>The Body Turn:</strong> Use a small body turn to power the swing. Don't just swing with your arms. The body's rotation helps control the clubface and provides the necessary speed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Module 14: Basic Bunker Play: Escaping the Sand</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-6 italic">For many beginners, a bunker is one of the most intimidating places on a golf course. However, with the right technique, you can learn to escape the sand with confidence. This module will give you the basic tools for a simple, effective bunker shot.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Bunker Setup: A Stable, Open Base</h3>
            <p>The setup for a bunker shot is all about creating the conditions for the club to slide under the ball, not hit it directly.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Open Stance:</strong> Aim your feet and body to the left of the target (for a right-handed golfer). This helps promote an outside-in swing path.</li>
                <li><strong>Open Clubface:</strong> Open the face of your sand wedge before you grip it. This adds loft and allows the club to "splash" through the sand.</li>
                <li><strong>Dig In:</strong> Dig your feet into the sand for a stable base. This is the only time in golf you are allowed to ground your club in a hazard.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Bunker Swing: The "Splash" Shot</h3>
            <p>The bunker swing is a committed, aggressive swing that hits the sand first, not the ball.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Hit Behind the Ball:</strong> The key is to hit the sand about 2 inches behind the ball. The force of the sand will propel the ball out of the bunker.</li>
                <li><strong>Accelerate Through:</strong> You need to be aggressive and accelerate through the sand. A timid swing will leave the ball in the bunker.</li>
                <li><strong>Full Follow-Through:</strong> Make sure you have a full, committed follow-through. The club should finish high and to the left of your target (for a right-handed golfer).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Module 15: Wedges: The Finesse Clubs</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-6 italic">Wedges are your scoring clubs. They are used for shots inside 120 yards and are crucial for saving strokes around the green. This module will introduce you to the different types of wedges and how to use them effectively.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Types of Wedges and Their Uses</h3>
            <p>A typical set of wedges for a beginner includes a pitching wedge (PW) and a sand wedge (SW). As you progress, you can add a gap wedge (GW) and a lob wedge (LW).</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Pitching Wedge (PW):</strong> Loft of around 44-48 degrees. Used for full swings from around 100-120 yards and for chip shots.</li>
                <li><strong>Gap Wedge (GW):</strong> Loft of around 50-52 degrees. Fills the distance gap between your pitching wedge and sand wedge.</li>
                <li><strong>Sand Wedge (SW):</strong> Loft of around 54-56 degrees. The most versatile wedge, used for bunker shots and short pitches and chips.</li>
                <li><strong>Lob Wedge (LW):</strong> Loft of around 58-60 degrees. Used for high, soft shots that land and stop quickly, such as over a bunker to a tight pin.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Using Your Wedges for Different Shots</h3>
            <p>The key to using your wedges is understanding that you can use a single wedge to hit many different shots by changing your swing length, ball position, and follow-through. This is known as "shot shaping."</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>The Half-Swing:</strong> For shots that are shorter than a full wedge, use a half-swing. The backswing and follow-through should be of equal length.</li>
                <li><strong>The Clock Face:</strong> A common method for controlling distance is to imagine a clock face. A swing to "9 o'clock" will go a certain distance, and a swing to "10 o'clock" will go a little farther.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Module 16: Course Management: Playing Smart, Not Just Hard</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-6 italic">Course management is the strategic thinking involved in navigating a golf course, making decisions that maximize a player's strengths and minimize their weaknesses. It is about playing smart, not just trying to hit the ball as hard as possible. This module will teach you how to think like a professional on the course, making better decisions that lead to lower scores.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Understanding Your Game: Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
            <p>The first step to good course management is to understand your own game. What are you good at? What are you not good at? If you are a beginner who struggles with a slice, you should not aim for the right side of the fairway where a hazard or trees might be. Instead, you should aim left, so your slice brings the ball back into the fairway. Playing to your strengths is the key.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Know Your Distances:</strong> Learn how far you hit each club. This is a non-negotiable part of course management. If you know you hit your 7-iron 150 yards, you can confidently choose the right club for your shot.</li>
                <li><strong>Analyze the Course:</strong> Before each shot, analyze the course. What are the hazards? Where is the best place to miss? A good player knows where to aim their shot, even if they don't hit it perfectly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Strategic Play: Thinking Your Way Around the Course</h3>
            <p>Course management is about making choices that give you the best chance of success, not just the most glorious shot. Sometimes, the smart play is to lay up with an iron instead of trying to clear a water hazard with a driver.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>The Smart Play:</strong> When faced with a difficult shot, a good player will often choose a "safe" shot that leads to a simple next shot, rather than a risky one that could lead to a penalty.</li>
                <li><strong>Playing for the Center of the Green:</strong> For approach shots, aim for the center of the green. This gives you the biggest margin for error and a high probability of a two-putt.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Golf Etiquette: Playing with Respect and Flow</h3>
            <p>Etiquette is about being considerate of other players and the golf course itself. It's how you show that you're a good playing partner.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Pace of Play:</strong> Be ready to hit your shot when it's your turn. Don't waste time. Walk at a good pace between shots.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Quiet and Still:</strong> Don't talk or move when someone is hitting a shot. Their concentration is key.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect the Course:</strong> Replace your divots in the fairway and rake the sand in the bunkers after you hit a shot. Repair ball marks on the green.</li>
                <li><strong>"Fore!":</strong> If you hit a shot that might be headed toward another person, yell "FORE!" as loud as you can to warn them. This is the most important rule of safety.</li>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">What to Do When Your Ball is Out of Play</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Out of Bounds (OB):</strong> This is an area marked by white stakes. If your ball goes out of bounds, you must take a <strong>1-stroke penalty</strong> and re-hit your shot from the original spot.</li>
                <li><strong>Lost Ball:</strong> You have 3 minutes to search for a lost ball. If you can't find it, you must take a <strong>1-stroke penalty</strong> and re-hit from the original spot.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Hazard:</strong> A water hazard is marked by red or yellow stakes. If your ball goes into a water hazard, you have a few options, all of which come with a <strong>1-stroke penalty</strong>. You can re-hit from the original spot, or take a drop at a specified location (details vary by hazard type).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Relief from Obstructions</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Movable Obstruction:</strong> Things like a rake in a bunker or a discarded beer bottle are "movable obstructions." You can move them without penalty.</li>
                <li><strong>Immovable Obstruction:</strong> Man-made objects like sprinkler heads, cart paths, or drainage grates are "immovable obstructions." If your ball or your stance is interfered with, you are entitled to a <strong>free drop</strong> within one club-length of the nearest point of relief.</li>

            <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-6 italic">Not every shot will be from a perfect lie in the middle of the fairway. This module will give you some simple strategies for dealing with some of the most common "trouble" shots, such as hitting from the rough, under a tree, or from a downhill lie.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Hitting from the Rough</h3>
            <p>The rough is designed to be a penalty for a missed shot. When hitting from the rough, you need to be realistic about your expectations.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Club Selection:</strong> Take a more lofted club than you would normally. The thick grass will grab the club and slow it down, so a 9-iron will often go the same distance as a 7-iron.</li>
                <li><strong>Get it Back in Play:</strong> The goal is to get the ball back into the fairway. Don't try to be a hero and hit it 200 yards to the green. A punch shot with a short iron is often the smartest play.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Hitting from a Downhill Lie</h3>
            <p>When your ball is on a downhill lie, your body will naturally want to lean back. To counteract this, you need to adjust your setup.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Align your shoulders with the slope. Your lead shoulder should be lower than your trail shoulder.</li>
                <li><strong>Swing:</strong> Swing with the slope, not against it. Your swing path will naturally be steeper, so don't be surprised if you take a deeper divot.</li>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Structured Practice: Quality Over Quantity</h3>
            <p>The goal of practice is not just to hit balls, but to hit balls with a purpose. A structured practice session should include a variety of drills that focus on all aspects of your game.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>The Warm-up:</strong> Start every practice session with some light stretching and a few easy shots. This prepares your body for the physical demands of the swing.</li>
                <li><strong>The Fundamentals:</strong> Spend time on your grip, posture, and stance. Use a mirror or a training aid to ensure your fundamentals are sound.</li>
                <li><strong>Drills:</strong> Work on specific drills that target a weakness in your swing. For example, if you are struggling with a slice, use a drill that helps you get the clubface square at impact.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Importance of Professional Golf Lessons</h3>
            <p>Professional golf lessons offer personalized feedback and instruction tailored to an individual's unique needs, strengths, and weaknesses. This contrasts with generic advice and allows instructors to identify subtle errors that a beginner might miss. A good instructor is an invaluable resource for accelerating your learning and building a solid swing that will last a lifetime.</p>

            <p>It's easy to get caught up in a driving contest with the person next to you. Don't. Use your time at the range to work on your swing, not to impress others. Your goal is to hit quality shots, not just long ones.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>The "Hit, Evaluate, Adjust" Method:</strong> Don't just hit ball after ball. Hit a shot, watch the ball flight, feel what your body did, and then make a small adjustment for the next shot.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice with Your "Half-Set":</strong> Don't feel like you need to hit every club in the bag. A good practice session can be done with just your 7-iron and a wedge.</li>

            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>The Ladder Drill:</strong> Place three balls at different distances from the hole. Try to make each putt, but more importantly, try to get them to stop at the hole, not past it.</li>
                <li><strong>The String Drill:</strong> Place a string on the ground to create a straight line. This will help you see if your putter face is square at impact and if your path is straight.</li>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Drills for Reading the Green</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>The Gate Drill:</strong> Place two tees a little wider than your putter head. This creates a "gate" for your putter to swing through, ensuring a consistent path.</li>
                <li><strong>The AimPoint Method:</strong> Stand behind your ball and use your fingers to "read" the slope of the green. This can give you a better idea of the line you need to take.</li>

This module will introduce you to some basic exercises and stretches to improve the key physical attributes needed for a powerful and consistent swing.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Flexibility: The Key to a Full Turn</h3>
            <p>A full, athletic turn in the backswing requires a great deal of flexibility in your torso, hips, and shoulders. Simple stretches can make a world of difference.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Torso Rotations:</strong> Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and gently rotate your torso from side to side.</li>
                <li><strong>Hamstring Stretches:</strong> Good hamstring flexibility helps you maintain a proper posture throughout the swing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Core Strength: The Foundation of Power</h3>
            <p>Your core muscles are the link between your upper and lower body. A strong core is essential for a powerful and controlled swing.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Plank:</strong> The plank is a simple, yet effective exercise for building core strength.</li>
                <li><strong>Medicine Ball Throws:</strong> This is a great exercise for mimicking the rotational movement of a golf swing and building explosive power.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-gray-400 text-lg mb-6 italic">You have now completed the comprehensive guide! The final module will help you transition from a self-learner to a golfer with a clear path for continued improvement. It's about taking the knowledge you've gained and applying it in a structured way to reach your goals.</p>

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Finding the Right Instructor</h3>
            <p>Even with all this knowledge, the best way to improve is with personalized feedback. A good golf instructor can watch your swing, identify your weaknesses, and give you specific drills to fix them. Look for an instructor who is patient, a good communicator, and aligns with your learning style.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Setting Realistic Goals</h3>
            <p>The goal is to get better and have more fun. Setting realistic goals will help you stay motivated and track your progress.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Short-Term Goals:</strong> "I want to be able to hit my 7-iron consistently 150 yards."</li>
                <li><strong>Long-Term Goals:</strong> "I want to break 90 by the end of the season."</li>
                <li><strong>Measure Your Progress:</strong> Track your rounds, your stats, and your practice sessions. You can't improve what you don't measure.</li>
            </ul>
